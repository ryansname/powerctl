- Derived sensors in stats worker
  - Stats worker could inject derived display data (e.g., current_solar_generation = solar1 + solar2)
  - Avoids repeating calculations in multiple downstream workers
  - Needs mechanism to define derived value configs (source topics, aggregation method, percentile/window)
  - Derived data should be added dynamically by files that need it, enabling locality and debugging without decoupling definition from usage
