- Derived sensors in stats worker
  - Stats worker could inject derived display data (e.g., current_solar_generation = solar1 + solar2)
  - Avoids repeating calculations in multiple downstream workers
  - Needs mechanism to define derived value configs (source topics, aggregation method, percentile/window)
  - Derived data should be added dynamically by files that need it, enabling locality and debugging without decoupling definition from usage
  - Requires: "plugin"-ish system for workers to register their own topics

- Use the proposed derived sensor system to implement the median calculations

- Prevent MQTTSender.Send() from blocking workers indefinitely
  - Bare channel send blocks forever if 100-msg buffer fills (mqtt_sender.go:33-35)
  - If MQTT broker is slow, all publishing workers freeze (including safety-critical ones)
  - Non-blocking drop is only safe for periodic state updates (SOC, debug sensors)
  - One-shot events (calibration refs) and service calls (inverter off) have internal state
    that won't re-trigger after a drop — these need guaranteed delivery or explicit retry
  - Needs careful per-caller analysis; may need separate channels or priority levels

- Handle initial MQTT connection failure (mqtt_worker.go:82-85)
  - If initial client.Connect() fails, function returns normally (not a panic)
  - SafeGo treats it as clean exit, does NOT retry
  - SetAutoReconnect(true) only works after successful first connection
  - System starts without MQTT connectivity and never recovers

- Handle HA placeholder states consistently (mqtt_worker.go)
  - "Undefined", "unavailable", and "unknown" are filtered at MQTT ingress
  - Consider whether other placeholder values exist (e.g., "none", "")
  - The TODO comment about tracking how long sensors have been invalid still applies
